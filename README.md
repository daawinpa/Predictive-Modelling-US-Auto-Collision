# Predictive-Modelling-US-Auto-Collision
This project develops a scoring model that would be used for assigning Loss Cost to vehicles using HLDI data.

The Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI)
maintains flat text files that contain the vehicle specifications, vehicle features, and information for VIN pattern decoding.

The full Shiny App for the final model can be found at this link  https://daawinpa.shinyapps.io/SFBCICSymbolsApp/
